
Regular Expression -

    A regular expression is a sequence of characters that construct a search pattern.
    It is used for pattern matching and search and replace function on text.
    
    Syntax -
    var pattern = new RegExp(pattern,attributes);
    var pattern = /pattern/attributes

    pattern is string that specifies pattern of regular expression



Modifiers -
    We have 3 types of modifiers -
    g : it performs a global match
    i : it performs case-insensitive matching
    m : It performs multiline matching


Brackets - 
    [abc] : Finds any character between the brackets.
    [^abc] : Finds any character NOT between the brackets.
    [0-9] : Finds any digits between the brackets.
    [^0-9] : Finds any non-digit NOT between the brackets.


METACHARACTERs - 
    
    w - It looks for a word character
    W - It finds a non-word character
    d - It finds a digit
    D - It finds a non digit character
    s - It finds a whitespace character
    S - It finds a non-whitespace character
    b - It finds a match at the beginning/end of a word
    B - It looks for a match, but not a the beggining/end of a word
    f - It finds a form feed character
    r - It finds a carriage return character
    v - It finds a vertical tab character
    t - It finds a tab character


Quantifiers - 
    
    here below it can be any character in place of a

    a* : it matches any string that contains zero or more occurrence of a
    a? : it matches any string that contains zero or one occurrence of a
    a{N} : it matches any string that contains a sequence of N a's
    a{N,M} : it matches any string that contains a sequence of  N to M a's
    a{N,} : it matches any string that contains a sequence of atleast N a's
    a$ : it matches any string a at the end of it

Object Properties - 

    constructor : Returns the function that creates the RegExp object's prototype
    global : Checks whether the "g" modifier is set
    ignoreCase : Checks whether the "i" modifier is set
    lastIndex : Specifies the index at which to start the next match
    multiline : Checks whether the "m" modifier is set

Object Methods - 

    Complie() : It compiles a regular expression
    exec() : It tests for a match in a string and returns the first match
    test() : It tests for a match in a string and return true or false
    toString() : it returns the string value of the regular expression
